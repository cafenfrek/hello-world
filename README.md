# hello-world
My Initial Repository - To be used for new ideas and brainstorming of those ideas...and maybe some kudos!

My name is Jack. If you know me, then you know Jack...heck you might even know Jack Shit!
I am working to become nerdy and technical again.  Github will help me with that...I hope!
Thanks to the former Marine Sniper, who sits in my cubicle, for encouraging me to explore new digital places.

Until next time, word to your motherboard!
